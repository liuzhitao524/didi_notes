FTP ports:
	Command port : 21
	Data port: not always 20;
Tow modes:
	Active mode：图见activeftp；
			In active mode FTP the client connects from a random unprivileged port (N > 1023) to the FTP server's command port, port 21.
		 Then, the client starts listening to port N+1 and sends the FTP command PORT N+1 to the FTP server.
		连接过程解释如下：
			1.FTP server's port 21 from anywhere (Client initiates connection)
			2.FTP server's port 21 to ports > 1023 (Server responds to client's control port)
			3.FTP server's port 20 to ports > 1023 (Server initiates data connection to client's data port)
			4.FTP server's port 20 from ports > 1023 (Client sends ACKs to server's data port)
		

	
	Passive mode: 图见passiveftp
		    In passive mode FTP the client initiates both connections to the server, 
	   solving the problem of firewalls filtering the incoming data port connection to the client from the server. 
		连接过程如下：
			1.FTP server's port 21 from anywhere (Client initiates connection)
			2.FTP server's port 21 to ports > 1023 (Server responds to client's control port)
			3.FTP server's ports > 1023 from anywhere (Client initiates data connection to random port specified by server)
			4.FTP server's ports > 1023 to remote ports > 1023 (Server sends ACKs (and data) to client's data port)
